                             as a string, in the id attribute.This is an XML attribute common to all View objects (defined by the View class) and you will use
                             it very often
                             wrap_content tells your view to size itself to the dimensions required by its content.
                             match_parent tells your view to become as big as its parent view group will allow.
                             TextSize will give size of the text-->
